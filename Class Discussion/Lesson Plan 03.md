1. What is a view?
-The UI and part of Three-Tier Architecture./An engine which is the component responsible for processing a view in order to generate a response for the browser./Used to render some part of the model as a user interface.

2. What is the similarity between view names and controller names? What is the diffrence between the two?
-They are a part of the MVC pattern./Views contain the logic required to display elements of the model to the userâ€”and nothing more, where Controllers are the bridge between views and the model

3. Where in the directory structure of an ASP.NET MVC application do views live?
-Views can be found in the Views folder. Each view is further organized into subfolders based on their controller.

4. What is a ViewBag object? What does it do?
-All data is passed from the controllers to the views via a ViewDataDictionary 
(a specialized dictionary class) called ViewData. The ViewBag leverages the dynamic 
keyword to create a dynamic wrapper around ViewData. ViewBag is just syntactic sugar 
that some people prefer over the dictionary syntax. It just looks nicer.

5. What does the at symbol (@) do? Can you excape it? If so, how?
-The magic character that precedes code instructions./Yes, by using // and /* *? comment delimiters

6. What are view conventions and how do they work?
-Reverse of the default settings

7. What is a ActionResult object? How do these objects interact with views?
-An ActionResult object is an instance of the ActionResult class. 
They contain the information that the view converts into HTML to send to the browser.

8. What are strongly typed views?
-A view intended to render a specific domain type, with shortcuts created by MVC.

9. How does Razor combine HTML and C# code?
-Razor allows you to insert C# code into HTML using the @ sign. 
It effectively converts the code to HTML before it is passed to the browser.

10. Where do layouts live in the directory structure of an ASP.NET MVC application?
-In the shared folder of the Views folder.

11. What are the dfferences between a partial view and a \full view?"
-The partial view itself looks much like a normal view, except it doesn't specify a layout; 
if the layout is specified by a _ViewStart.cshtml page (and not directly within the view), the layout is not rendered.
